===========================
HTTP reverse proxy (dinghy)
===========================

The default reverse proxy registers automatically any Docker container with ``VIRTUAL_HOST`` and ``VIRUTAL_PORT`` to
it's configuration so multiple containers are accessable from outside without using other ports.

Also containers from docker-compose are registerd by this reverse proxy: ``project_app_1`` -> ``app.project.docker``
